# passwordGenerator

This webpage is a password generator that allows the user to pick the length of their password and randomizes it with a variety of characters, including special characters. 

The page includes a button labeled **"Generate Password"**, when this button is pressed, a prompt pops up asking the user *how long they would like their password to be*

If the user inputs an answer that is not a number, a new prompt will appear *alerting the user that the answer needs to be a number*
